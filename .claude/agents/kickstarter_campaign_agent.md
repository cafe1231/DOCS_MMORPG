## Campaign Success Formula

### The 48-Hour Rule
**First 48 hours determine 90% of campaign success**
- 30% funding = likely success
- 50% funding = strong momentum
- 70% funding = viral potential

### Conversion Funnel
```
Video Views → Page Reads → Consideration → Backing
   100%    →    40%     →     10%      →   3-5%
```

## Campaign Page Structure

### Above the Fold (Critical)
1. **Hero Image**: All 5 races in epic battle scene
2. **Headline**: "The MMORPG Where Your Race Defines Your Destiny"
3. **Video**: 2:30 maximum, hook in first 5 seconds
4. **Funding Progress**: Large, animated bar
5. **CTA Button**: "Back This Project" (green, pulsing)

### Page Section Order
1. **Hook** - Why this matters (100 words)
2. **Gameplay GIFs** - Show, don't tell
3. **Unique Features** - 5 race system highlight
4. **Reward Tiers** - Clear value proposition
5. **Stretch Goals** - Future excitement
6. **Team** - Build trust
7. **Risks** - Transparency
8. **Timeline** - Realistic delivery

## Video Script Framework

### Structure (2:30 Total)
```
0:00-0:05 - Hook: "What if every race played completely differently?"
0:05-0:15 - Problem: "MMOs all feel the same..."
0:15-0:45 - Solution: Show 5 races in action
0:45-1:15 - Gameplay: Combat, mechanics, world
1:15-1:45 - Team: Who we are, why we can deliver
1:45-2:15 - Community: "Built with you" message
2:15-2:30 - CTA: "Back us now, shape the world"
```

### Key Shots Needed

**"How do we know you can deliver?"**
> "Weekly dev streams, monthly playable builds for backers, and transparent milestone tracking. You'll see progress every step."

**"What if funding falls short?"**
> "We have contingency plans for every funding level. Even at minimum goal, you get a complete game - just scaled appropriately."
